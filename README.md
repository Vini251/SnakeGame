# SnakeGame
This is an old famous game of Snake. 
Here Snake is controlled by the keys on keyboard to go up, down, left or right. 
Snake is moved to eat food.
As snake eats food it gets bigger and bigger.
At higher level, it will get difficult to handle the snake because if it hits the tail game is over.
Similarly, if it hits the wall game is over. 
High score is collected and stored, so when you play it next time high score is still displayed.
